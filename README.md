### Hey, I'm Stefan

I am a graduate student at Georgia Tech. My research focuses on [hardware acceleration for machine learning](https://sharclab.ece.gatech.edu/research/). I also work on my own project using [deep learning for hurricane forecasting](https://github.com/stormalytics/hurricane-forecasting). During my summers, I teach high school students scientific computing, data science, and machine learning as part of their [research program](https://www.ahschool.com/broward-campus).

In my own time, I like learning and experimenting in areas such as music production / music synthesis, open-source hardware, and meteorology / earth science / remote sensing.
