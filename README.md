### Hey, I'm Stefan

I am a graduate student at Georgia Tech. My research focuses on hardware acceleration for machine learning. I also work on a project using deep learning for hurricane forecasting. During my summers, I teach high school students scientific computing, data science, and machine learning as part of their research program.

In my own time, I like learning and experimenting in areas such as music production / music synthesis, open-source hardware, and meteorology / earth science / remote sensing.
